## üìã **Enhanced Test Flow Example**

### Before (Old Format):
```
‚îå‚îÄ HTTP Server Basic Functionality ‚îÄ
  ‚îú‚îÄ Testing: Server startup and basic HTTP response
  ‚úì PASS: Server responds to HTTP requests
```

### After (New Enhanced Format):
```
‚îå‚îÄ HTTP Server Basic Functionality ‚îÄ
üìã AUDIT QUESTION:
How does an HTTP server work?

Expected Answer: An HTTP server listens for TCP connections, parses HTTP requests,
processes them according to configuration, and sends back HTTP responses.
Our server uses epoll-based I/O multiplexing for handling multiple concurrent connections.

  ‚îú‚îÄ Testing: Server startup and basic HTTP response
  ‚úì PASS: Server responds to HTTP requests
  
Press ENTER to continue to manual verification...

üîç MANUAL VERIFICATION:
1. Open your browser and navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:8888/
2. Verify the page loads correctly showing the localhost HTTP server welcome page
3. Check browser developer tools (F12) -> Network tab
4. Refresh the page and verify HTTP/1.1 protocol in the request/response headers
5. Verify you see proper headers like 'Server: localhost-http-server/0.1.0'

Press ENTER to continue to next test...
```

## üîß **Specific Enhancements by Test Category**

### **1. HTTP Server Basics**
- **Audit Question**: "How does an HTTP server work?"
- **Manual Steps**: Browser testing, dev tools inspection, header verification

### **2. I/O Multiplexing (Epoll)**
- **Audit Questions**: 
  - "Which function was used for I/O Multiplexing and how does it work?"
  - "Is the server using only one select (or equivalent)?"
- **Manual Steps**: strace command usage, system call verification

### **3. Single Thread Operation**
- **Audit Question**: "Why is it important to use only one select and how was it achieved?"
- **Manual Steps**: Process monitoring, thread count verification under load

### **4. HTTP Methods**
- **Audit Questions**: 
  - "Are the GET requests working properly?"
  - "Are the POST requests working properly?"
  - "Are the DELETE requests working properly?"
- **Manual Steps**: Browser testing, Postman usage, status code verification

### **5. Error Handling**
- **Audit Questions**:
  - "Test a WRONG request, is the server still working properly?"
  - "Try a wrong URL on the server, is it handled properly?"
- **Manual Steps**: Browser 404 testing, malformed request testing

### **6. CGI Support**
- **Audit Question**: "Check the implemented CGI, does it work properly with chunked and unchunked data?"
- **Manual Steps**: Browser CGI testing, POST data verification, environment variables

## üöÄ **How to Use Enhanced Testing**

### **Interactive Demo**
```bash
./interactive_audit_demo.sh
```

### **Individual Enhanced Tests**
```bash
./test_all_audit_requirements.sh basic     # Enhanced basic test
